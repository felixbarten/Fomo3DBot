## What is Fomo3D

Fomo3d was a popular game on the Ethereum blockchain back in 2017. It was a ponzi scheme type game that put a severe strain on the network for the time it was popular. 

I wrote this bot for educational purposes. It has been my introduction to web3.js, node.js and blockchain programming.
